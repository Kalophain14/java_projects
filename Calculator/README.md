A beginner Java learning project — built to practice core Java concepts like classes, loops, conditionals, and event handling using Java Swing. Styled after the Apple iOS calculator.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Percentage and square root (`√`)
- Sign toggle (`+/-`)
- Keyboard support
- Apple-inspired dark UI
